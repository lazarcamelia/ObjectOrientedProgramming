Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the problem you have been working on (Labs 5,6,7,8), using Qt. 

You must implement the design of the interface and the list/table displaying the repository entities (administrator mode) should be 
populated. The GUI must be created and coded manually (no Qt Designer!).
