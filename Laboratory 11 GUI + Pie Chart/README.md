Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the problem you have been working on (Labs 5,6,7,8), using Qt. 

You must implement the design of the interface and the list/table displaying the repository entities (administrator mode) should be 
populated. The GUI must be created and coded manually (no Qt Designer!).

Bonus (0.2 p)

Create a graphic representation of the data in your application. You have an example at the link above: a bar chart representing the number of songs for each artist. Your representations can be a bar chart, a pie chart or another type of chart. You can even use circles or rectangles or any other geometric shapes to “draw” your data.
