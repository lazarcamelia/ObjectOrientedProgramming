EC-PD morgue assistant mode: an assistant can access the program and choose one or more victim files to mark as unconnected to the string 
of murders or to move to other departments for research, in the event of new findings. The program will allow the assistant to:

1. See the victim files in the database, one by one. When the assistant chooses this option, the data of the first victim (place of origin, 
name, age) is displayed, along with its post-autopsy photograph.

2. Choose to transfer the file to another department, in which case the victim file is added to the assistant's “to be transferred” list.

3. Choose not to transfer the victim file and to continue to the next. In this case, the information corresponding to the next victim file
is shown and the assistant is again offered the possibility to transfer it. This can continue as long as the assistant wants, as when 
arriving to the end of the list, if the assistant chooses next, the application will again show the first victim file.

4. See all victim files of a given place of origin, having an age less than a given number. If the place of origin is empty, then all 
victim files will be considered. The same options (a, b and c) apply in this case.

5. See the list of victim files selected to be removed as irrelevant or transferred to other departments for additional research.
